## Node.js RETS Client
This is a (very) beta Node.js RETS client. The purpose of this module is to establish a connection to a RETS provider and perform most of the common queries.
If you are experienced with RETS and would like to assist with this development your help would be very welcome.

## Usage Example
Below is a very simple example that simply establishes a RETS connection with digest authentication and then loads an object containing all available classifications.

```javascript

var RETS = require( 'rets' );

// Create Connection.
var client = RETS.createConnection({
  host: 'www.some-rets-provider.com',
  path: '/login.asps',
  user: 'ricky-bobby',
  pass: 'talladega'
});

// Trigger on successful connection.
client.once( 'connection.success', function connected( client ) {
  console.log( 'Connected to RETS as %s.', client.get( 'provider.name' ) )

  // Fetch classifications
  client.get_classifications( function have_meta( error, meta ) {

    if( error ) {
      console.log( 'Error while fetching classifications: %s.', error.message );
    } else {
      console.log( 'Fetched %d classifications.', Object.keys( meta.data ).length );
      console.log( 'Classification keys: %s.', Object.keys( meta.data ) );
    }

  });

});

// Trigger on connection failure.
client.once( 'connection.error', function connection_error( error, client ) {
  console.error( 'Connection failed: %s.', error.message );
});
```

If there are no errors, the above code should result in the following console messages:

 - Connected to RETS as "Ricky Bobby, Inc.".
 - Fetched 6 classifications.
 - Classification keys: REN,CML,MUL,LND,CMS,RES.
